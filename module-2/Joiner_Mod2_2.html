        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>
        <p><span class="intro">Hello! My name is Mark Joiner. I live in Birmingham, Alabama and I work for Frito-Lay. I have three siblings, two sisters and a brother along with 6 dogs. I attended Pinson Valley High School, and then I attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was also in band for 12 years, and played the French Horn.</span></p>
        <p>My hometown is a small place called Pinson. It's about 30 minutes outside of Birmingham, and I've lived here all my life. Everbody knows everyone here!</p>
        <p>My hobbies include many things! I like to play video games, cook, go on hikes, read books, and rollerskate to name a few. My life definitely doesn't slow down, even on my off days!</p>
        <p>My dream job one day is to be a video game developer. I want to graduate Bellevue University, and work my way up to game development. It might be a long shot, but I think I can do it! <span class=sentence> All I need to do is believe in myself, and I can make anything happen.</span></p>
